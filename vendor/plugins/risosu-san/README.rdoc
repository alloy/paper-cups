A lean mixin for <tt>ActionController::Base</tt> that assists in situations
where a resource controller is nested under another resource. Eg:

  /members/24/passwords/new

In this example, retrieving the parent resource is as simple as:

  class PasswordsController < ActionController::Base
    find_parent_resource :only => :new
    
    def new
      @parent_resource # => #<Member id: 24>
      @member # => #<Member id: 24>
    end
  end

See RisosuSan for a bit more in depth documentation.
