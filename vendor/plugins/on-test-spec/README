On Test Spec
------------

Makes testing Rails apps with test/spec easier and more fun. Created with a
half eye on the test_spec_on_rails plugin, thanks!

Autotest
--------

To use autotest with test/spec on Rails, copy the "dot.autotest" sample file to
your project's root directory and name it ".autotest". Edit the file if you
need any custom mappings.
