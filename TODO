- When going to ‘earlier messages’, it links to the same day at the top. Might be related to TZ.

- Add a ‘services’ controller which authenticates a user based on a token and loads something like service specific class to handle creating a message for that service. At first this will be a github hook thing only.
- Add an overview page of attachments.
- Let the user cancel changing the topic by clicking outside of the input.
- Make styling a bit nicer: names of members should fit and scroll whole page and make sidebar fixed.
- Create enter/leave messages and also use these to track the status of the authors.
  Also store the last message id on the room instance, this allows us to check if
  anything changed at all since a specific message id.
- Use 'js' instead of json on rooms controller to be consistent with the messages controller.
- Think about the best way to make search actually scale. MyISAM / thinkingsphinx.
