- Add timestamps in between messages that are more than 5 minutes apart.
- Add an event listener so ‘enter’ submits the new message and ‘alt+enter’ inserts a new line.
- Make styling a bit nicer: names of members should fit and scroll whole page and make sidebar fixed.
- Use Ajax for creating new messages.
- Don't try to retrieve new messages and focus on the textarea if browsing an archive.
