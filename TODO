- If we ever add more rooms then Message.recent should check the membership of the room instead of author creation date.
- Show twitter links inline.
- Compact search result messages to one line, highlight query, and add a link to the message #id.
- When going to ‘earlier messages’, it links to the same day at the top. Might be related to TZ.
- Add StackOverflow-like back-tick operator for in-line syntax highlighting
- Configure the syntax highlighter, I don't think we need those buttons, except copy to clipboard.
- Add an overview page of attachments.
- Let the user cancel changing the topic by clicking outside of the input.
- Make styling a bit nicer: names of members should fit and scroll whole page and make sidebar fixed.
- Optimize/cache:
  - Store the last message id on the room instance, and a hash representing online members, topic,
    and attachments. This allows us to check if anything changed at all since a specific message id.
- Use 'js' instead of json on rooms controller to be consistent with the messages controller.
- Think about the best way to make search actually scale. MyISAM / thinkingsphinx. But for now it works good enough.
