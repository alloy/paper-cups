- Add timestamps in between messages that are more than 5 minutes apart.
- Make styling a bit nicer: names of members should fit and scroll whole page and make sidebar fixed.
- Create enter/leave messages and also use these to track the status of the authors.
  Also store the last message id on the room instance, this allows us to check if
  anything changed at all since a specific message id.
- Use 'js' instead of json on rooms controller to be consistent with the messages controller.
- Don't try to retrieve new messages and focus on the textarea if browsing an archive.
- Double check all authorization rules and add missing coverage.
