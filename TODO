- Before next deploy make sure to move attachments into shared and link before restart!
- Update files list.
- Let the user cancel changing the topic by clicking outside of the input.
- Make styling a bit nicer: names of members should fit and scroll whole page and make sidebar fixed.
- Create enter/leave messages and also use these to track the status of the authors.
  Also store the last message id on the room instance, this allows us to check if
  anything changed at all since a specific message id.
- Use 'js' instead of json on rooms controller to be consistent with the messages controller.
- Think about the best way to make search actually scale. MyISAM / thinkingsphinx.
